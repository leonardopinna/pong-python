# Pong Game by Leonardo Pinna

## Important premise

This project is simple, and the main goal of the development of the app is to learn Python3 and Pygame while exploring functionalities. So, do not expect rocket-science complexity in this project. Also, I will upgrade the code to reduce computing resource usage (for example, removing the rendering of static elements every frame) and improve some functionalities like the collision model and the scoring system.

## Description

## How to start playing

Right now, the only way to play this game is to download the package and from the terminal run

```
cd <repo-folder> && python3 ./src/main.py
```

to launch the main.py file.
You can ONLY run this game in MACOS systems.

## Suggestions

If you notice any bugs, or want to suggest improvements, feel free to contact me! I do not expect many messages, as it is all very simple, but I will be very happy to get in touch with you!
